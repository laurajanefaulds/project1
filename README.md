### Contents

- pie_chart.py: This code generates a pie chart to visualize the proportion of confirmed deaths and probable deaths for a selected state.

- descriptive_statistics.py: This code calculates descriptive statistics for the 'Red Cases' and 'Blue Cases' columns in a DataFrame.

- linear_regression.py: This code performs linear regression on the 'Red Cases' and 'Blue Cases' columns in a DataFrame and calculates evaluation metrics.

- t_test.py: This code performs an independent two-sample t-test on the 'Blue Cases' and 'Red Cases' columns in a DataFrame and prints the t-statistic and p-value.

- geocoding.py: This code performs batch geocoding of state names using the Nominatim geocoder and creates a dictionary mapping state names to latitude and longitude coordinates.

- `map_visualization.py`: This code creates a map visualization using geospatial data and the Folium library. It plots markers for each state in the DataFrame, showing the state name, total cases, and total deaths.

### Instructions

To use these code snippets, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`, `scipy`, `geopy`, `geopandas`, and `folium`. You can install them using pip or conda.

2. Open the desired code snippet in a Python environment or editor.

3. Modify the code as needed, such as selecting a specific state or providing the path to the data file.

4. Run the code and observe the output or visualization generated.

5. Repeat for other code snippets as needed.

Please note that these code snippets are provided as-is and may require additional modifications or adaptations to suit your specific use case or data format.
